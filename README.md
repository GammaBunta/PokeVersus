## What is Pokemon Versus 

PokeVersus is a 10 days project.
It is a web-site created with Angular which allows to know the damage according to the type, level, etc of the pokemon. 
We used the API named "PokeAPI", link : `https://pokeapi.co/`. 


## Version : 
This version is the final one, it can really be improved. A lot of parameters are approximated. 



## GETTING STARTED  : 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
